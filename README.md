Residual Emotional Risk in AI Systems 

Why Emotional Risk in AI Cannot Be Fully Engineered Away

This repository contains the official white paper Residual Emotional Risk in AI Systems, which presents a practical risk analysis of how modern AI systems interact with human emotion, language, and expectation  and why certain emotional risks remain even in well designed, well intentioned systems.

The paper offers a realistic, field informed perspective on AI limitations, human communication uncertainty, and the shared risk zone that emerges between them. It avoids blame, fear, or sensationalism, and instead focuses on clarity, responsibility, and expectation alignment for companies, developers, policymakers, and the public.

Abstract

Modern Artificial Intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in emotionally sensitive contexts  including mental health adjacent conversations, safety related interactions, and high trust human support environments.

While AI excels at pattern recognition, it does not access inner human states. Emotional expression in humans is indirect, culturally shaped, and linguistically unstable. This creates an unavoidable layer of uncertainty at the intersection of AI interpretation and human communication.

This white paper introduces the concept of Residual Emotional Risk the category of emotional misalignment risk that remains even after strong engineering, safeguards, and good intentions are applied. It examines AI side constraints, human expression variability, shared interaction risk, cultural and gender ambiguity, and the downstream business and public impact of misinterpretation.

Rather than proposing oversimplified solutions, the paper emphasizes realistic capability framing, humility in system design, transparent limitation acknowledgment, and public literacy as core safety strategies.

Through a balanced and non accusatory lens, this work aims to support safer AI deployment by aligning expectations with reality strengthening trust not through overconfidence, but through honesty about limits.
